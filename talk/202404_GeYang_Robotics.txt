Abstract: Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence have produced a trifecta of new techniques in generative modeling, computer graphics, and representation learning that once combined, will lead to radical changes in robotics. In this talk, we will study robot perception as an ill-defined inverse problem whose goal is to infer knowledge of the environment from noise and partial observability. We will start with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and study ways to combine them with prior knowledge from Foundation Models that are trained over internet-scale datasets to give robots the ability to know what is where in their surrounding environment. We will then look at the AI debate over priors vs data, and discuss how it is affected by recent results from OpenAI sora, the state-of-the-art AI system for generating videos from text.
