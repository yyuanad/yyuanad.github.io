Abstract: The future of AI is in creating systems like foundation models that are pre-trained once, and will handle countless many downstream tasks directly (zero-shot), or adapt to new tasks quickly (few-shot). In this talk, I will discuss our vision-language approach to achieving “Computer Vision in the Wild (CVinW)”: building such a transferable system in computer vision (CV) that can effortlessly generalize to a wide range of visual recognition tasks in the wild. I will first describe the definition and current status of CVinW, and briefly summarize our efforts on benchmark and modeling. I will dive into Large Language-and-Vision Assistant (LLaVA) and its series, including LLaVA-Med, LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, LLaVA-Interactive, LLaVA-Plus. LLaVA family represents the first open-source project to exhibit the GPT-4V level capabilities in image understanding and reasoning. demonstrate a promising path to build customizable large multimodal models that follow humans' intent with an affordable cost.
