Abstract: 3D generation has received growing attention due to its potential in modeling the 3D visual world. Despite remarkable advancements, there remains a significant journey ahead. In this talk, we will explore three key aspects of 3D generation. Firstly, we will focus on geometry quality, delving into the design of the discriminator. This crucial component has often been overlooked in many existing 3D generative approaches. Secondly, we will examine the realm of animatable human generation, probing into techniques and challenges associated with this dynamic aspect of 3D modeling. Lastly, we will discuss strategies for constructing a foundational model tailored for 3D generation, aiming to provide a robust framework for further advancements in the field.
